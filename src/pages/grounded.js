          Grounded: The Pandemic Archive is a project that serves to take a
          snapshot of the COVID-19 pandemic. Users are encouraged share how they
          have found new meaning in the physical spaces and objects around them
          while in quanatine. Each submission consists of an image and a story,
          which can be recorded or typed. Built in collaboration with Design for
          America, I led the site's frontend work.
          <br />
          <br />
          The site is currently down, as we are in the process of scaling our
          backend in preparation for a second, more expanded phase of
          submissions. In the meantime, I have linked a copy of the frontend.
