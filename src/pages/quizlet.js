            Quizlet is a online platform that creates tools for studying and
            learning used by 60 million people each month. Users can create and
            share sets of digital flashcards that can be studied with these
            tools, also known as study modes. People use the platform to study
            everything from high school vocabulary to medical school anatomy.

            As an intern, I worked on the Learning Assistant team, which works
            on the Learn study mode. After inputting their study goals and
            preexisting knowledge on the content they are studying, the Learn
            mode creates a personalized learning session for them. The Learn
            mode automatically generates multiple choice, written, and flashcard
            based questions that are given to the user across the learning
            session.
